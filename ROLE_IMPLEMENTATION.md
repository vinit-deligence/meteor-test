# Role-Based Access Control Implementation

## Exploration and Analysis

### Initial Codebase Exploration
1. Started by examining the core files:
   - `imports/ui/App.jsx` - Main application structure
   - `imports/ui/Users.jsx` - User management component
   - `imports/ui/Files.jsx` - File management component
   - `server/main.js` - Server-side setup and user seeding

2. Key findings:
   - User seeding with predefined roles in `server/main.js`
   - Basic role-based UI elements already in place.
   - Roles to be implemented: ADMIN, VIEWER, and GUEST

### Focus Areas

1. **Role Definitions and Checks**
   - Verify role constants and helper functions
   - Confirm async nature of role checks
   - Identify need for proper error handling

2. **File Access Control**
   - Analyzed `Files.jsx` component structure
   - Identified key areas for role-based restrictions:
     - File previews
     - Open buttons
     - Metadata access

3. **UI/UX Considerations**
   - Loading states for role checks
   - Clear feedback for restricted access
   - Consistent user experience across roles

## Implementation Process

### 1. Role Check Integration
- Added role checking in `Files.jsx` using `useEffect`
- Implemented parallel role checks using `Promise.all`
- Added loading state management

### 2. File Access Control
- Modified `FileCard` component to accept `canAccess` prop
- Added conditional rendering for:
  - File previews
  - Open buttons
  - Access restriction messages

### 3. Loading State Management
- Added separate loading states for:
  - Role checks
  - File data loading
- Implemented proper loading indicators

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Asynchronous Role Checks
**Challenge**: Role checks are asynchronous, requiring careful state management
**Solution**: 
- Used `useEffect` for role checks
- Implemented proper loading states
- Added error handling

### 2. UI Consistency
**Challenge**: Maintaining consistent UI while restricting access
**Solution**:
- Kept file cards visible for all roles
- Added clear access restriction messages
- Maintained layout consistency

### 3. Role Verification
**Challenge**: Ensuring proper role assignment and checking
**Solution**:
- Verified role assignments in `server/main.js`
- Used existing role check functions
- Added error logging for debugging

## Verification Process

### 1. Role Testing
- Tested with different user roles:
  - Admin: Full access to all features
  - Viewer: Access to file previews and open buttons
  - Guest: Limited to basic file information

### 2. UI Verification
- Confirmed proper loading states
- Verified access restriction messages
- Checked responsive behavior

### 3. Login & Logout
- Implemented login and logout functionality for role-based access testing
- Verified behavior by logging in with different user accounts  

### 4. Error Handling
- Tested error scenarios:
  - Network issues during role checks
  - Invalid role assignments
  - Missing user data
